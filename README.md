finds game pin you must set it up on your own 

this is best for people that know a little bit how code works and if you don't you could probably just ask chatgpt to expaln it to you.

-please have python installed before opening you also need to configure the code yourself the fixer.txt should help a bit feel free to add whatever you want to it.

also make sure to have https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki This is REQUIRED to make the project work and run the code (pip install pillow pytesseract pyautogui pygame) before starting!
